# ReactRecipeSharingPlatform

This is a full-stack web application built with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and Passport.js on the backend. The application uses PostgreSQL for data persistence.

The goal of this project is to create a platform where users can create their own accounts and share their favorite food recipes. Users can add their own recipes for others to see, and search for recipes added by other users. This makes it a great place for food enthusiasts to share and discover new recipes.

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, providing a robust and type-safe user interface. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, providing a fast and efficient server. User authentication is handled by Passport.js, and user data and recipes are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

This project is currently a work in progress. Future updates will include more features and improvements to the user interface and server.
